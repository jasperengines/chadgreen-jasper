# Hi, I'm Chad 👋

## Senior Systems Architect @ Jasper Engines & Transmissions 🚗

I architect event-driven, serverless solutions for Infinity Cloud using cloud-native practices on Azure. My focus is transforming how we build scalable, resilient systems that power the future of automotive remanufacturing.

### 🎯 What I'm Working On
- Designing next-generation cloud architectures for Jasper's Infinity Cloud platform
- Building event-driven systems that scale with our business
- Championing serverless and cloud-native patterns across the organization
- Mentoring teams as we establish world-class development and platform engineering practices

### 💡 Beyond the Code
I believe great architecture is about empowering people, not just building systems. That's why I'm passionate about:

- **Technical Education**: Creating documentation that actually helps teams succeed
- **Community Leadership**: Organizing events that bring technologists together
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Speaking at conferences and workshops to share what we've learned

### 🎤 Speaking & Community
I regularly speak at technical conferences and community events, sharing insights on:
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Serverless best practices in Azure
- Building developer-friendly infrastructure
- Creating technical documentation that tells a story
